          </div>
        <div class="box-1 bounce">  
          <p>Musical talents at a young age, bought him a guitar when he was 10 yrs. old. Great was his passion for music that he would travel penniless and hungry all the way to Chennai, a journey of 270 miles by train, to receive a half hour lesson from a renowned teacher on Classical Music. Nothing else mattered to him except the honing of his Musical Skills, and he was prepared to give up on everything he loved and held dear, just to be able to excel in his Art.<br>

            Soon gigs started pouring in and he became a Guitarist with a vast and versatile range of Musical genres that ranged from Jazz, Country, Rock, Classical and Spanish styles. This remarkable flexibility in his Music kept him busy throughout the year playing for Corporate Launches, Jingles, Theatre, 5-Star Hotels and other recordings.<br>

          Many doors have opened for Ebenezer to travel overseas. He was recently invited by the United Nations in New York to play in the cause of Religious Tolerance in India and his performance in a Ken Ham Creation Museum in Cincinnati received a standing Ovation for his performance. He is often invited as a guest lecturer at various Universities in the United States, including the prestigious Liberty University in Lynchburg. Ebenezer has played and worked with many World-Renowned Artists like Don Moen, Bob Fitts, Paul Baloche, Ron Kenoly, Paul Wilbur, Lenny LeBlanc, Tommy Lane, Israel Houghton, Jessica Cole and many more Grammy Award Winning Artists.<br>

          Ebenezer John is a pioneer in a style called the Percussive Acoustic Guitar and Alternative Tuning Styles which is a unique style played by very few in the world.</p>
